## Build inline JSON

- Requires Node.js installed.
- Command: `npm run build:inline`
- What it does:
  - Reads `data.global.js`, extracts the dataset, and writes `data.min.json`.
  - Inlines minified JSON into `index.html` under `<script type="application/json" id="a2z-json">`.
  - The app then loads data from the inline JSON for faster parse and no extra requests.
